## Problem Statement
Build a simple decomposed Key-Value store by implementing two services which communicate over gRPC.

The first service should implement a basic JSON Rest API to serve as the primary public interface. This service should then externally communicate with a second service over gRPC, which implement a basic Key-Value store service that can:

- Store a value at a given key
- Retrieve the value for a given key
- Delete a given key
